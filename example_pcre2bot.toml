# example_pcre2bot.toml â€“ pcre2bot's config file example
#
# References:
#   https://github.com/toml-lang/toml
#   https://metacpan.org/pod/TOML::Tiny
#
# Usage:
#   All keys values that expect a string must be quoted, i.e. nickname = 'pcre2bot',
#   but keys that expect a boolean integer value (1 = True; 0 = False), i.e. use_tls = 1.
#   To enable the logger, just set a path where the logs should be saved.
#
# Notes:
#   To connect to a server securely with TLS, the 'use_tls' key must be set to 1,
#   and 'port' set to a TLS port accepted by the server.
#   To connect with a self-signed certificate, both 'tls_cert' and 'tls_key' need
#   to be specified.
