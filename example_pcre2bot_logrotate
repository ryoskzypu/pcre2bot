# example_pcre2bot_logrotate â€” pcre2bot's logrotate conf file example
#
# Description:
#   Manage pcre2bot's rotation of its logs with logrotate.
#
# Usage:
#   Make sure logrotate is installed and this file is installed in /etc/logrotate.d
#   with root permissions.
#   Also logrotate's systemd.timer or cron job must be enabled.
#
#   Testing:
#     # To test the kill command and apply the changes, remove --debug option.
#     sudo logrotate --debug --verbose -f /etc/logrotate.d/example_pcre2bot_logrotate
#
# Notes:
#   In this file example, pcre2bot's log files will be rotated and compressed weekly.
#   The rotate count is 4 and size 20M, meaning that from each log file, only 4
#   will be kept and only be rotated if they grow bigger than 20 megabytes.
#   After every log is rotated, a HUP signal is sent to pcre2bot to restart itself,
#   so it can reopen its filehandles and resume writing to its log files.
#
#   Also, it assumes that pcre2bot is installed and executed from $HOME, so adjust
#   the filepaths from logs section i.e '~/pcre2bot/irclogs/*.log {', and awk's
#   regex in lastaction accordingly.
