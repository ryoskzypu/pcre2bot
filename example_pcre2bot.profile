# example_pcre2bot.profile â€” pcre2bot's firejail profile example
#
# Description:
#   Run pcre2bot in a sandbox.
#
# Usage:
#   firejail --quiet --profile=./example_pcre2bot.profile ./pcre2bot example_pcre2bot.toml --ac
#
# Notes:
#   - This profile can be useful if the user wants to sandbox pcre2bot while being
#     able to interact with it, since systemd services are detached from TTY.
#     The drawback is that it cannot control resources efficiently like systemd.
#
#   - If logging is enabled and the log filepath is different than ~/pcre2bot/irclogs,
#     it will need to be set (e.g. in a whitelist: 'mkdir /tmp/irclogs', 'whitelist /tmp/irclogs').

# Hide $HOME directory while allowing ~/perl5 (perlbrew's dir) directory to be
# readable; also ~/pcre2bot read-writeable.

# Notes:
#   - This allows pcre2bot to access perlbrew's perl + cpanm modules. Also pcre2bot's
#     dir will be persistent and able to write to its logs.
#   - Because of sandboxing, any log dirs in ~/pcre2bot (e.g. irclogs), must be
#     created before starting the service.
